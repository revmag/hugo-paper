summary = """
Over-collateralized lending dApp with two tokens: CORN (collateral) and ETH (borrowable).
Users deposit CORN as collateral and can borrow ETH against it, but only within a safe limit. If their collateral ratio drops below 110%, the position is flagged for liquidation : protecting the system while keeping lending secure."""
