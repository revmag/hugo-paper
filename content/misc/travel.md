Have discovered traveling to me means meeting the local people and understanding their culture, and less visiting the touristy places.
Still discovering what it means to me( I know this much I like adventure sports)

>Places I have been to - ( International)

London - oxford, loved seeing the student culture there, all the touristy places 

Singapore - been here twice , universal studios, botanic gardens ( played with turtle here ğŸ¥°), visited NUS ( befriended a local here and learnt a bit about Singaporeâ€™s culture ), and strolled around gardens by the bay area, won $10 in casino ( probability rate of winning 97% but expected value is -100)

Malaysia - ( here for only 6 hours, went to Legoland and tried Thai massage and ate McDonald's )

Japanâ€” went to kyoto, tokyo, osaka

Vietnam - ( tried selling coffee beans here ğŸ˜‚)

>Places ( National) â€” 

Chennai ( went to meet a friend working in  a deep tech startup to know more about the culture there)

Bangalore ( currently here, exploring the startup scene)
