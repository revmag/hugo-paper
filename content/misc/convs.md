> Conversations

Appeal to interest, not reason ~ Benjamin Franklin<br>
I try to use it very often.<br>
Try to get inside other person’s head and see things from their point of view.<br>
And try to map, whatever action that other person is doing, at some point of your life, you would have been doing the same thing, so what were you thinking at that time, and how you could rectify that.<br>

And most of the things in the real world are governed by incentives, so maybe think what incentive the other person might have that would be useful for you to guide the conversation.


> How things happen in the real world

Its not money, per se.<br>
I see many of my friends not able to solve their problems( which seem quite simple at this point).<br>
Its a base heuristic,  which I use often, whenever I encounter a real world problem.
Its leveraging use of personal connections, focus( people dont really know what it means, and even I am exploring it continuously), and self belieft.<br>
I spend a lot of time actually trying to understand the problem,  and thinking very hard, before I solve it. And I figured very less people( <1%) even understand what the problem is. That’s why progress is so slow.

The way to develop personal  connections, is taking great care of the people you are with, and helping them grow. Nothing beats that. And being kind and helpful to everyone.

I went after understanding crazy growth by doing startups.<br>
And I learnt a lot.<Br>
Major is, the most important thing is, knowing oneself, what are one's priorities, the kind of thing one likes, is the person driven by money, impact or what, how one works, what is someone passionate about <br>

And it's probably very hard, I still don't know
