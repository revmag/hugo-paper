The woods are lovely, dark and deep.  
But I have promises to keep,  
And miles to go before I sleep,  
And miles to go before I sleep.

## My story
Now this is tricky, so many parts.

Let me start from college.
I was never one to stick to just one lane - I thrived on exploration.
I jumped into a **brand-new branch**, started **2 clubs** from scratch, and set up discussion groups that brought people together around new ideas. 
My path has been anything but linear, full of experiments and discoveries.

Post that, I’ve worked on **mechanistic interpretability**, taught students using ChatGPT when the tech was just becoming mainstream, and even **lived on a farm** to experiment with selling crop data to traders. 
At a startup, I built **voice-driven features** that pushed the boundaries of how humans interact with machines. 
I’ve dabbled in everything from tackling cancer research to exploring blockchain.

If there’s a theme that ties it all together, it’s adventure—jumping into new terrains, learning fast, and seeing what’s possible. Every turn has opened up a fresh perspective.
