title = "Grapes Farm data using S1 & S2 satellite sensors"
summary = """
Analyzed grape farms using spectral angle mapping: first segmenting fields with SAM (Segment Anything), then computing the spectral angle of each pixel against known grape reference points to classify whether an area was a grape farm or not.  \n

Beyond the technical work, I traveled across Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Pune to study how horticulture crop trading actually happens on the groundâ€”demoing the solution to farmers and traders, and learning firsthand about the challenges of agricultural markets.
